# Hello-World
A basic test of C++. To see if this works, download the zip, then extract it. Extraction speed depends on you computers power. It normally takes little to no time to extract the .exe because it's a small command prompt program.
Go into your command line through the following methods:

hit Ctrl + R at the same time to launch "Run", then type cmd and click OK or hit the Enter key

go to your task bar, then type in cmd, command, or command prompt

find "Command Prompt" in start menu.

After that, type: cd (path to folder location goes here)\Hello-World-Main\Hello-World-Main.

Type in HelloWorld.exe and FLASH! Hello world runs.
